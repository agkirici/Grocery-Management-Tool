# Grocer Management Tool
A basic Python script that sorts your grocery list by where items are located in a specific store.

# Grocery Management Tool - Simplifying Your Shopping
Are you tired of navigating chaotic grocery stores with an unorganized shopping list? The Grocery Management Tool is here to make your grocery shopping experience smoother and more efficient.

# Why Use the Grocery Management Tool?
Have you ever found yourself wandering through a store, zigzagging from one end to the other, trying to find items from an unsorted list? Or perhaps you're shopping with your kids, and suddenly you realize you forgot something on the other side of the store. These frustrating situations inspired the creation of the Grocery Management Tool.

# How It Works
- Place your unorganized grocery list in the "unsortlist" folder.
- Run the "lister.py" script.
- Select your preferred grocery store from the menu. While the current options are limited to my usual stores, the goal is to expand the list to include more stores.
- Choosing your store also determines the optimal shopping route through the store. For example, it might suggest starting with produce, then dairy, followed by meat, and so onâ€”tailored to each store's layout.
- The script then takes your list, checks each item against the store's layout, and generates a new organized list sorted by store sections.

# Future Improvements
1-Streamline the process for defining grocery sections, possibly using a keyed dictionary for better clarity.
2-Incorporate a feature to handle "new" items by prompting the user to assign them to a store section.
3-Implement date coding for lists to track shopping history.
4-Expand the list of supported stores.
5-Explore the possibility of integrating with store APIs (e.g., Wegmans) to access their in-store product data.
6-Consider transitioning to a user-friendly GUI interface and eventually transforming it into a standalone app.
